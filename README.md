## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using NASA's API, users may enter in a date. NASA will respond with an image or video "of the day" This media is then displayed to the User to show them something amazing from world of astronomy.

## Optimizations

Need to make a better layout for easier readability and media viewing. Need to add CSS classes to prevent accidental style overrides. Need to add better responsiveness possibly by introducing the srcset attribute.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to send GET requests to APIs and how to handle the data that the API responds with.
